# Applied Mathematics Lab — Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of **mini projects** developed throughout the Applied Mathematics Lab course.  
Each project explores a different mathematical model or computational technique using Python.

At present, the repository includes one completed project.

## Current Projects

### Mini Project 1 — Spruce Budworm Dynamics

This project studies the spruce budworm population model, a nonlinear one-dimensional ordinary differential equation (ODE) arising in ecological modeling.  
The project combines qualitative analysis, numerical simulation, and an interactive visualization using Streamlit.
